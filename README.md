# Predicting Wine Quality

This aim of this project was to accurately predict the quality of a range of different red wines based upon their chemical features. I completed this project to practice the skills and techniques I had learned after completing Jose Portilla's "Python for Data Science Bootcamp" course on [@Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/learn/lecture/17739846?start=0). I was able to produce a range of models for the two questions asked within this project, with the bets performing model obtaining 85% accuracy on the test set used.
