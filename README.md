# Predicting Wine Quality

This aim of this project was to accurately predict the quality of a range of different red wines based upon their chemical features. I completed this project to practice the skills and techniques I had learned after completing Jose Portilla's "Python for Data Science Bootcamp" course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/learn/lecture/17739846?start=0). I was able to produce a range of models for the two questions asked within this project, with the best performing model obtaining 85% accuracy on the test set used.

## Technologies

This project was created using a Jupyter Notebook with the following package versions installed:

* Python: 3.7.7
* Imbalanced-Learn: 0.7.0
* Numpy: 1.19.1
* Pandas: 1.1.0
* Seaborn: 0.10.1
* Scikit-Learn: 0.23.1
* Matplotlib: 3.2.2

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Each of the 11 independent variables within the dataset was analysed against the target variable. I analysed the correlations amongst the indenpendant variables. Below are some of the highlights from the EDA.
